The above output has 3 basic sections

    summary of activity 
    histogram of latency
    SQL execution plan


Summary of Activity
The “summary of activity” section is a breakdown of how the time is spent in the trace file.
The most important statistic to compare is the column “total sec.”
 If there are any rows here that show significantly more wait time on virtual, then that issue should be addressed.
There are basically 3 types of events in the Summary section


        CPU and Elapsed
        Non-I/O wait events such as lock, latch, space allocation
        IO wait events

1) The CPU and Elapsed can vary for a number of reasons. Elapsed includes idle time, so if the session being traced was idle for different amounts of time then the two traces can have different Elapsed time. The CPU should be relatively the same if the boxes are the same type.
2) The other wait events should account for roughly the same amount of time. The counts can be different and the events can be different, but if there is some event that takes up much more time in one trace than the other trace then that can point to some problem or configuration difference between the databases. For example if a lock shows up in one and not the other, then in one case there is a blocking session slowing down this trace, where as if the other trace has no locks then it was not blocked by another session. In this case there would be an application problem in one trace and not the other.
3) The I/O events are the ones that are of most interest for Delphix since Delphix primarily impacts I/O. The number of I/Os should be the same between physical and virtual. If the counts are significantly higher on virtual then the reason for the high count should be investigated and corrected before delving farther into the Delphix stack.

Comparing the count columns might look like
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       physical| virtual      
-------------------------------|--------
           event        count  |  count 
db file sequential read  9451  |  76259  
db file scattered read     17  |   7196 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Which would mean that the the virtual read more data than the physical thus there is something different on the virtual, other Delphix,  that should be addressed before looking into any issues because of Delphix.
The rows to compare are I/O the possible I/O rows are:
read I/O

        db file sequential read
        db file scattered read
        direct path read
        direct path read temp

The count for these events should be roughly the same. If the count is higher for virtual then virtual is doing one the following:

    reading more data – customer has added or change data
    has less data cached in the Oracle buffer cache -
        either the buffer cache is smaller
            see init.ora parameter db_block_buffers
            or run command “show sga” in sqlplus and look at value “Database Buffers”
        or the buffer cache has has yet to cache the data because one of the following
            first time query has been run
            no other query retrieving the relevant data has been run
            other queries have forced out the relevant data by  filling the buffer cache with data unrelated to this query
    has a different execution plan – see “ SQL execution plan”  below

If the counts are roughly the same on physical and virtual but the the “avg ms”, ie the average time waited per event, is higher then look at the histogram of latency. See below
write I/O

            direct path write
            direct path write temp
            log file sync

The count for these events should be roughly the same. If the count is higher for then the virtual is doing a different workload:

direct path write – query is inserting more data
direct path write temp – query is sorting more data or the memory the user is allowed to use for sorting is smaller
log file sync – query/job is committing more.
histogram of latency

If the list of events and count of events are roughly the same  in “summary  of activity” section yet the read I/O events showed significantly more time on virtual,  then histogram section will give more detail about these I/O read latency. The goal of the latency histogram is primarily to see if virtual and physical were using the same amount of host file system cache. There is no general method currently of seeing which I/O came from file system cache or from SAN cache or actually from physical disk, but given the limits of current hardware one can make some strong inferences from the the latency distribution. Latency under 64 microseconds is generally going to be coming from local file system cache. (on 4Gb FC it takes 20us just to transfer an 8K block not accounting for any code stack, scheduling or memory or disk access).

Here is an example comparing physical to virtual for single block reads, which Oracle calls “db file sequential read”
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Histogram of latencies  for:
                                 db file sequential read
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
     0   64u    .1m  .2m   .5m    1m   2m   4m    8m   16m   33m  65m  .1s .1s+
Virtual
     0      1    14  908  13238 6900 9197 15603  9056   265   26   12   12
Physical
     0   7132   391  118  22189 2794 1688  2003 11969 14877 2003  105    3   3  

(The first column “0? is for any for any reads which reported no latency. This column should have 0 occurrences.)

The column “64u” is the 64 microsecond bucket. On physical there were 7132 reads where as on  virtual there was on 1  indicating that the physical was benefiting from more reads from the host file system cache.
One should be able to rectify this difference by re-running the query again on the virtual database. A second running of the query should benefit from the data cached in the file system cache by the first execution. Other issues which will affect how much data gets cached in the file system cache are

    amount of memory on the machine
    amount of memory allocated to all processes
    activity of processes on the host

The second part the latency histogram is for I/Os that read multiple blocks. The latency for these reads is broke out by the size of the I/O as well as the time. The amount of I/O read in a multiblock read can vary for a number of reasons, but the bulk of I/O sizes should be the same and the max I/O size for each type of I/O should be the same.
SQL execution plan

The next section gives details on each SQL statement in the trace file. There maybe be multiple SQL statements. Some of the SQL statements will have been explicitly run and others may have been kicked of by Oracle to look up relevant information.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Breakdown by SQL Statement
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The statements are ordered by elapsed time with the slowest statements listed first.Find compare each of the statements that took  a significant amount of time and compare the execution plans of these statements. For example if the two two equivalent SQL statements had the following SQL execution plans
UPDATE  TOTO                                UPDATE  TOTO
   FILTER                                            FILTER  
     NESTED LOOPS                                      NESTED LOOPS  
       NESTED LOOPS                                        NESTED LOOPS  
         SORT UNIQUE                                          INDEX RANGE SCAN TOTO_IDX 
           TABLE ACCESS FULL SUPPORT                          SORT UNIQUE   
         INDEX RANGE SCAN TOTO_IDX                    TABLE ACCESS FULL SUPPORT 
       TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID TOTO            TABLE ACCESS BY INDEX ROWID TOTO
   TABLE ACCESS FULL SUPPORT                   TABLE ACCESS FULL SUPPORT 


Then the execution plans woudl be different because the order or the lines in the execution plan are different.The Oracle optimizer has changed the execution plan because of :

        different statistics on the underlying tables
        missing or new indexes on the tables
        different Oracle configuration parameters such as

            db_file_multiblock_read_count
            optimizer_index_cost_adj
            optimizer_index_caching
            or others
